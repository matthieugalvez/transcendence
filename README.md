The current project setup is just a basic setup to run the frontend independently using vite as a bundler (no framework). https://vite.dev/guide/#overview


##You need to update NODE on your session before running:

```
# Download and install nvm:
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash

# in lieu of restarting the shell
\. "$HOME/.nvm/nvm.sh"

# Download and install Node.js:
nvm install 24

# Verify the Node.js version:
node -v # Should print "v24.1.0".
nvm current # Should print "v24.1.0".

# Verify npm version:
npm -v # Should print "11.3.0".
```

Then run
```
npm install

and

npm run dev:full // Start the backend and frontend at the same time


npm run build // Compile dev build

or

npm run dev // Run dev frontend

or

npm run server:dev //Run Fastify backend server
```

site will be accessible on localhost:5173

(Vite is used for fast dev environment, and bundling (combining multiple file into fewer, optimizing the development) we can not use it for the backend though as per discord #staff-pedagogy).

For the database:

```
For VSCode quickview:
